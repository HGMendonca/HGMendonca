- 👋 Hi, I’m Henri Mendonça, I'm currently doing my master's degree in physics with an emphasis on strongly correlated systems at the Federal University of Uberlândia, particularly superconductor simulation.
- 👀 I’m interested in computational physics, material simulation, and high-performance computing.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python language, Python compilers, and Fortran 77/90.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulating materials, particularly simulating strongly correlated systems.
- 📫 The best way to contact me is via email: irneh.gm@gmail.com
